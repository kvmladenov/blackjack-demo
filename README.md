The animation should be similar to moving a card
from the deck to its position on the table. Card 1 should appear from the “Deck” and go to its position on the
table (Image 2). Card 2 should appear from the “Deck” and go to its position on the table (Image 2). The same
should happen for Card 3. Card A should also appear from the deck and go to its position on the table (Image
2). The same should happen for Card B. There should be button on the table with label “Hit”. When the player
presses the button “Hit”, Card A and Card B should disappear from the table and new Card A and Card B should
be placed on the table coming from the “Deck”. If the player presses Card A or Card B, the pressed card should
disappear (with animation). Cards from the “Deck” should be generated at random
